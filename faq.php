                    <li>Skeptics are allowed on the site, however this is not a debate site, it is meant for people to document their encounters and interactions should take place accordingly.</li>

                <p>What is Sasquatch/Bigfoot?</p>
                <p>Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch) is a North American cryptid.
                    According to most accounts, Bigfoot lives in the forests, is covered in dark brown hair, and stands somewhere between 6-10 ft tall.</p>
                
                <p>What are Sasquatch encounters usually like?</p>
                <p>Sasquatch encounters can take many forms, Although some common types include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seeing a large, hairy, ape-like creature standing at a distance either watching or slowly moving through the forest</li>
                    <li>Finding one or more large, humanioid footprints much larger than any person would make</li>
                    <li>Hearing loud vocalizations in the forest that don't seem to match any other creatures in the area</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Isn't Sasquatch just a myth or a hoax?</p>
                <p>While there is little hard scientific evidence for the existance of Sasquatch, and there are inevitably a wide array of hoaxes,
                    the best evidence is not as easily dismissable as most people might think. A small set of examples are given below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A number of videos exist from before widely accessable video editing that show Sasquatch clearly enough to not be a a black bear,
                        which is commonly mistaken for Bigfoot when one stands on its hind legs.</li>
                    <li>Many footprint castings have an extraordinary amount of detail that would be incredibly difficult to fake accurately.
                        This includes very fine toe print patterns and the footprints having the correct depth for a creature of its height and weight.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>What should I do if I have an encounter?</p>
                <p>You should stay away and do not approach or try to interact. Both Sasquatch and other animals commonly mistaken for it are dangerous and should be left alone.
                    If you do have an encounter, regardless of if you take any pictures or not, you should create a post here to document it and discuss it with others.
                    Just remember to follow the site rules posted above.</p>
